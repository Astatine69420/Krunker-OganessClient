# idkr
idk, just a Krunker client

## Features
### Settings
- Disable Frame Rate Limit -s
- ANGLE Grapchics Backend -s
	- Performance of the client can be affected by this option
	- If you experiencing problems like crashes, try using different backend
	- May not work outside of Windows, I will investigate this later
- Color Profile -s
- Auto Update Behavior
	- Setting this to "Download" is highly recommended but other options are here just because you can
- Enable Resource Swapper -s
	- Put swap files in `<documents>/idkr/swap`
- Enable Userscripts -l
	- Put userscripts in `<documents>/idkr/scripts`
	- Only use truly trusted scripts, they are danger than web extensions. Seriously.
